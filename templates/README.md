## Questions

For the questions, make sure:

* there is a line at the top that reads:
```
;type your name after the colon:
```

* The question starts with:
```
; Question 1:
```
Make sure to replace the 1 with the question number, and make sure the questions are in ascending order.

If you want to display the same answer for multiple questions, start your question like so:

```
; Question 1,2,3,4, 5:
```

* The question ends with:
```
;end
```

* The output tests at the end of the rkt file are displayed like so:
```
Q1 passed 4/5
```
Make sure to replace the number to the left of the / with the marks obtained and the numbers to the right of the / with total marks. Write down "passed" even if the answer gets a 0. The "passed" indicates the program didn't crash.
