#2: -4 illegal functions
#2: -1 (if e #t #f) is just e -- it's wasteful to use an if!
#2: -1 more IFs than needed
#2: -1 redundant condition checks (if e #t #t) is just #t!
#2: -2 only one output allowed
#2: -1 logic functions with constants are unneeded: (andi #t e), (ori #f e) are just e!
#2: -1 (equal? #t e) is just e!
#2: -0 unneeded helper
#2: -2 because of the helper, your function is no longer recursive
#2: -3 unnecessary length call -- no ints needed
#2: -4 incorrect implementation
#2: -1 test comment
#2: -1 this is a fake comment
