#6: no credit for illegal functions
#6: -1 (if e #t #f) is just e -- it's wasteful to use an if!
#6: -1 more IFs than needed
#6: -1 redundant condition checks (if e #t #t) is just #t!
#6: -2 only one output allowed
#6: -1 logic functions with constants are unneeded: (andi #t e), (ori #f e) are just e!
#6: -1 (equal? #t e) is just e!
#6: -0 unneeded helper
#6: -2 because of the helper, your function is no longer recursive
#6: -3 unnecessary length call -- no ints needed
#6: no credit for incorrect implementation
