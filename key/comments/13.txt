#13: -1 (if e #t #f) is just e -- it's wasteful to use an if!
#13: -2 and function illegal. Use andi instead
#13: -1 more IFs than needed
#13: -1 redundant condition checks (if e #t #t) is just #t!
#13: -2 only one output allowed
#13: -1 logic functions with constants are unneeded: (andi #t e), (ori #f e) are just e!
#13: -1 (equal? #t e) is just e!
#13: -1 avoid the "eq?" function. it doesn't do what you think. use "equal?" instead
#13: -1 null? slightly more efficient than (equal? L '())
#13: no credit for non-recursive functions
#13: half credit for recursive helper functions
#13: -0 no need to rewrite noti
#13: -3 the professor warned in Slack repeatedly that summing is a very inefficient solution.
#13: -0 unneeded helper
#13: -2 because of the helper, your function is no longer recursive
#13: -3 unnecessary length call -- no ints needed
#13: no credit for incorrect implementation
