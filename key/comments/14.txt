#14: -2 and function illegal. Use andi instead
#14: -1 more IFs than needed
#14: -1 redundant condition checks (if e #t #t) is just #t!
#14: -2 only one output allowed
#14: -1 logic functions with constants are unneeded: (andi #t e), (ori #f e) are just e!
#14: -1 (equal? #t e) is just e!
#14: -1 avoid the "eq?" function. it doesn't do what you think. use "equal?" instead
#14: -1 null? slightly more efficient than (equal? L '())
#14: no credit for non-recursive functions
#14: half credit for recursive helper functions
#14: -0 no need to rewrite noti
#14: -0 unneeded helper
#14: -2 because of the helper, your function is no longer recursive
#14: -3 unnecessary length call -- no ints needed
#14: no credit for incorrect implementation
