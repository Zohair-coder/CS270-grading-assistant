#1: -1 credit for illegal functions
#1: -1 more IFs than needed
#1: -1 redundant condition checks (if e #t #t) is just #t!
#1: -2 only one output allowed
#1: -1 logic functions with constants are unneeded: (andi #t e), (ori #f e) are just e!
#1: -1 (equal? #t e) is just e!
#1: -0 unneeded helper
#1: -2 because of the helper, your function is no longer recursive
#1: -3 unnecessary length call -- no ints needed
#1: -2 incorrect implementation
#1: -1 this is a custom comment for testing purposes
