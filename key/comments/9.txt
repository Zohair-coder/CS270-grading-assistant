#9: -1 (if e #t #f) is just e -- it's wasteful to use an if!
#9: -2 and function illegal. Use andi instead
#9: -1 more IFs than needed
#9: -1 redundant condition checks (if e #t #t) is just #t!
#9: -2 only one output allowed
#9: -1 logic functions with constants are unneeded: (andi #t e), (ori #f e) are just e!
#9: -1 (equal? #t e) is just e!
#9: -1 avoid the "eq?" function. it doesn't do what you think. use "equal?" instead
#9: -1 your lambda is just andi!
#9: -1 null? slightly more efficient than (equal? L '())
#9: no credit for non-recursive functions
#9: half credit for recursive helper functions
#9: -0 unneeded helper
#9: -2 because of the helper, your function is no longer recursive
#9: -3 unnecessary length call -- no ints needed
#9: no credit for incorrect implementation
