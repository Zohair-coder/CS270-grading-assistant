(define (insert_binding binding table)
  (helper_insert_binding binding table))

;here is what I have from attempting to make it with a helper function
(define (helper_insert_binding binding table)
  (if (empty? table) null
      (cons
       (append binding (first table))
       (insert_binding binding (rest table)))))
