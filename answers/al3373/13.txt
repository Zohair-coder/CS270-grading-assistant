(define (atleast-one-true L)
  (foldr (lambda (x y) (or x y)) #f L));Utilized one of the functions in earlier homework where we checked for at least one true.
                                       ;Use fold with or in order to check if there's at least one true.
                                       ;This is because with the initial value #f, or can only be true if there's a #t in the list
