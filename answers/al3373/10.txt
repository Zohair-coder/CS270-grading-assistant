(define (extend_table var_name current_table)

;Check if the table is empty, if so, make the bindings for the variable. I was just using what the checks were saying.
;If it's not, then make bindings for the variable name, and then call insert_multiple_bindings on the current table
;in order to add the variable's bindings to the environments in the tbale
